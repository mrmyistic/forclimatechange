        <p id="text">Introduction:
There were 2 friends Abhi and Rahul planned for a ride on weekend. Rahul was
late to the meet up and when asked, he claimed that the road wasn't visible due
to dense fog causing jam and they later realized that the dense sinister caused is
by the smog .Discussing about it they slip into good climate convo...
They were concerned about the reasons for the present climatic circumstances
and started bringing nostalgia and were imagining peace of environment which
their heirs experienced. They realize that initiative should be taken by them to
have ultimate change.They began searching about the methods and
organizations dealing with climate action and made it their hobby to work
towards the change and found it worthy to be a part of it!
So how many of you will join Abhi and Rahul to be a part of Climate action and
be a Climate champion!! Scroll further and be a part of this auspicious activity....
You must be fond of the following aspects:
⟶ Age groups in the range 12-18 are often considered responsible for climate
change due to their roles in resource consumption,and industrial activities. The
lifestyle choices and consumption patterns contribute significantly to carbon
emissions and other environmental issues. This brief might have made you

ways.
⟶ The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to transform our world. They
are a call to action to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet, and ensure

piece of cake for the minds already capable of grasping things!
Why are we mainly responsible for the climate change?

What are the organizations that are needed to be aware of?
change science and provides policymakers with information to make informed

6. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC):
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an
international treaty adopted in 1992 to address the global challenge of climate
change. It provides a framework for negotiations and cooperation among

The current trend is going on with the vintage entities which is quiet interesting.
But that ain’t complete without the vibe of vintage climate! Just imagine the
blend of innovation with the older era...The peace gives a pure vibe right?
It can be achieved when innovation happen with the norms of SDGs’ and its only
possible by the young minds. There is still a way and you are the ones to pave it!
21/75 day plan to move more close to be a Climate Champion:
I am about to enter my prime and I will be responsible towards Climate activity
by considering SDGs' as devotion by following these traits:
• I will be cautious with energy consumption even it's plenty, will compress my
usage and make sure it ain't being wasted without the reason.
• Will have control over my luxury for usage of vehicles and adopt to fitness by
using physical methods to travel short distances.
• Will follow the trend of renewable resources and gain more knowledge about
climate change.
• Always have dangers of plastic in mind and be aware of using single use
plastics.
You as youth are capable of doing anything when united. The aggression
gives you the vibe of not giving up on the things which you want to happen.
Just imagine the outcomes when you use that will of yours’ to do something
good. It’s damn sure that there will be a huge impact. Just use if to add value
to the lives and do something for the future gen. DON’T LET IT BE OF VAIN!
Enter the vintage era with upgraded innovations....
• Maintain discipline and will respect the flora around me and prevent myself or
anyone from exploitation.
I promise to follow these aspects and update with honesty and be decent in the
journey of being a Climate champion!</p>
